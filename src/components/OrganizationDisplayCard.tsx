          A Wider Circleâ€™s efforts focus on the provision of basic need items,
          workforce development, wraparound support, and neighborhood
          revitalization. These four components work in concert to create
          lasting change in the lives of those we serve. A Wider Circle says no
          to nobody! Anyone in need of help can find it here.
